# trig_efficiency_check
Here I want to check the trigger efficiency calculated for the iDM analysis, in particular for the cross-trigger : "HLT_Mu3er1p5_PFJet100er2p5_PFMETNoMu100_PFMHTNoMu100_IDTight"
The MC sample : Mchi-60p0_dMchi-20p0_ctau-1.root correspont to 2018 where the trigger was available.
